# Polyglottal - Learn a New Language

## Learn a New Language

### Objectives

* Become a proficient independent language learner by learning a new language
* Be able to draw comparisons between JavaScript (or other languages you know) and the new language
* Learn how to use a new language and create a project
* Practice teaching others

## Picking a Language

### Requirements

We have a few requirements for the language you choose. Your chosen language MUST fulfill the following requirements:

* It must be a language you have never used before
* It must have a [package manager](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=package+manager) (like 'npm' or 'yarn')
* Language suggestions
  * Python
  * Ruby
  * Golang
  * Java
  * Rust
  * Scala
  * Haskell
  * C#

### Things to Research

* Is it already installed on your machine? If so, what version?
* Are there multiple versions of the language? Which is best?
* Is there an online sandbox for your language? Try it out!
* Google how to install your favorite version on your OS
* What is it’s package manager? None? Pick a new language.
* What IDEs are common?
* What testing suite is most popular?
* Figure out what website your package manager loads from
* Figure out what the relevant frameworks are
* Does your chosen language have a debugger?
* Search hacker news and reddit for the most controversial topics.

## Steps

* Install the language
* Install the package manager
* Build and run “hello world”
* Find a tutorial or project similar to what you want to build
* Build and run the project from the command line
* Pick an IDE and import
* Figure out how to debug
* Tear the project down to its core
* Build it back up in your vision

## Project/Research Tips and Suggestions

* Create an API for quotes! We have provided a `quotes.json` and a `quotes.txt` file for you to use. It is the same one you used when learning Node/Express.
* Find the ['koans'](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) for your chosen language! Koans is a nice, quick way to learn the environment setup, testing framework, and syntax of a new language. Do a quick Google search to find the koans for your language (i.e. 'ruby koans').
* Find a cheat sheet! While not in-depth, they do help if you need a quick reference.
* Avoid doing codecademy/prog8---while those are helpful when you are starting with your first language, you should try to 

## Present a Lesson

Create a lesson for your classmates in order to share what you have learned this week.

### Lesson Objectives

* For you: synthesize your learning by creating a lesson for your peers
* For your audience: become acquainted with the basics of an unfamiliar programming language

### Lesson Requirements

Please plan a lesson that meets the following requirements.

* Slides or other type of presentation.  Please include the following topics in your presentation:
  * Comparison of new language to JavaScript
  * Describe how testing works in the new language
  * Share challenges you experienced while learning the new language
  * Explain the strengths of the new language and describe what types of projects it is best suited for
  * Anything else that you believe would be beneficial
* GitHub repository. Create a repository your classmates can clone.  Include:
    * An installation guide
    * A simple, working version of the project you created.  Remove any partially completed features.
    * A list of resources that were helpful to you
* An activity that allows the class to try out the new language without installing it.  One possibility is to create a short exercise that can be executed in an online environment (like [JSbin](http://jsbin.com/) but for your language)
